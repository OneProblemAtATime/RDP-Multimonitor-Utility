RDP utility script
------------------

This script is designed to make multiscreen RDP sessions more convienent by providing a way to easily select any number of screens to use in the session.
This is resolved from the current all or single options in the basic windows user interface.

Drag a RDP file over the RDP_Util.exe to begin. 

Alternatively, one can can simply use the following for use in a batch script:
    RPD_util <path/to/the/session.rdp>
